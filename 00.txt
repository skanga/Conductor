> Give me some ideas for a killer app that I can use in a demo for the Conductor framework

● Here are some killer demo app ideas for the Conductor framework:

  1. AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

  - Analyzes pull requests, suggests improvements, identifies bugs
  - Uses multiple LLM calls: one for security issues, one for code quality, one for documentation
  - Shows parallel task execution and retry mechanisms
  - Great for showcasing workflow orchestration with real developer pain points

  2. Multi-Language Content Marketing Pipeline

  - Takes a blog post idea → generates content → translates to 5 languages → creates social media posts → generates
  images
  - Demonstrates complex DAG workflows with branching
  - Human-in-the-loop approval at key stages
  - Shows memory management with large content

  3. Research Paper Summarizer with Fact-Checking

  - Upload PDF → extract text → summarize → extract claims → verify against web sources → generate report
  - Highlights LLM tool calling (web search, document parsing)
  - Shows error handling when sources are unavailable
  - Impressive visual output with citations

  4. Automated Customer Support Ticket Router

  - Analyzes incoming tickets → categorizes → assigns priority → routes to right team → drafts responses
  - Demonstrates classification, sentiment analysis, and decision trees
  - Easy to show metrics/performance improvements
  - Relatable problem for any business audience

  5. Interactive Story/Game Generator

  - User provides premise → generates branching narrative → creates character profiles → generates images for scenes
  - Real-time interaction shows streaming capabilities
  - Fun and engaging for live demos
  - Shows creative AI applications

  6. Data Pipeline Orchestrator

  - Ingest data → clean → analyze → visualize → generate insights report
  - SQL queries, data transformations, chart generation
  - Shows integration with external tools
  - Appeals to data science/analytics crowd

  My recommendation: The Code Review Assistant (#1) or Content Marketing Pipeline (#2) would be most impressive
  because they:
  - Solve real problems developers/marketers face daily
  - Showcase multiple Conductor features naturally
  - Have clear before/after comparisons
  - Easy to extend with more complexity
